# Dynamic React Table

## Overview

This project features a **dynamic React-based table** that automatically updates its content based on external JSON data. By eliminating the need for manual adjustments, the table provides a flexible and maintainable UI component that adapts seamlessly as data changes.

## Why This Matters

Dynamic, data-driven components are essential in modern frontend development. This project demonstrates how full-stack engineers can build responsive interfaces that:

- Scale effortlessly with changing data  
- Reduce developer workload by minimizing manual updates  
- Improve user experience through real-time data reflection  

## Technologies Used

- React  
- JavaScript  
- JSON (for external data source)  

## Key Features

- Automatically renders table rows and columns based on JSON data structure  
- Handles varying data shapes without requiring code changes  
- Optimized rendering for performance and responsiveness  
- Clear component design with effective prop handling  

## What I Learned

- React fundamentals including component architecture and props  
- Efficient rendering techniques to optimize UI updates  
- Designing flexible components that adapt to dynamic data  
- Best practices for maintainable and scalable frontend code  

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed  
- Basic knowledge of React  

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dynamic-react-table.git

text

2. Navigate to the project directory:

cd dynamic-react-table

text

3. Install dependencies:

npm install

text

4. Start the development server:

npm start

text

5. Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` to see the dynamic table in action.

### Usage

- The table component fetches or receives external JSON data as props.  
- It dynamically generates table headers and rows based on the data keys and values.  
- Update the JSON data source to see the table automatically reflect changes without code modifications.

## Example

const data = [
{ id: 1, name: "Alice", age: 30, city: "New York" },
{ id: 2, name: "Bob", age: 25, city: "San Francisco" },
];

<DynamicTable data={data} /> ```
