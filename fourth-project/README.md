# Responsive Portfolio Gallery

## Overview

This project is a **responsive and interactive portfolio gallery** that enables users to filter projects by category. It showcases the importance of creating responsive UI/UX and implementing dynamic filtering to enhance user experience in modern web development.

## Why This Matters

Building responsive and user-adaptive interfaces is essential for engaging users across a variety of devices and screen sizes. This project helped me strengthen skills in:

- Responsive design using **Bootstrap**  
- Managing component state for dynamic filtering  
- Implementing intuitive user interaction logic  

These capabilities allow companies to deliver visually appealing portfolios and content showcases that effectively engage visitors on any platform.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5 & CSS3  
- Bootstrap  
- JavaScript (or React, if applicable)  

## Features

- Responsive layout that adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes  
- Dynamic filtering of portfolio projects by category  
- Smooth user interactions and state management for instant filtering  
- Clean and modern design for effective content presentation  

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript  
- Familiarity with Bootstrap framework  

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/responsive-portfolio-gallery.git

text

2. Navigate to the project directory:

cd responsive-portfolio-gallery

text

3. Open `index.html` in your browser to view the portfolio gallery.

### Usage

- Use the category buttons or dropdown to filter displayed projects dynamically.  
- The gallery layout adjusts responsively based on the device or window size.

## Example

<!-- Example of filter buttons --> <div class="btn-group"> <button class="btn btn-primary" onclick="filterProjects('all')">All</button> <button class="btn btn-secondary" onclick="filterProjects('web')">Web Development</button> <button class="btn btn-secondary" onclick="filterProjects('design')">Design</button> </div> ```
text
// Example filter function
function filterProjects(category) {
  const projects = document.querySelectorAll('.project-item');
  projects.forEach(project => {
    if (category === 'all' || project.classList.contains(category)) {
      project.style.display = 'block';
    } else {
      project.style.display = 'none';
    }
  });
}
