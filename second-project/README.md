# Weather App with Redux

## Overview

This project is a **weather application** built with **React** and **Redux** that displays real-time weather conditions by integrating the **OpenWeatherMap API**. It highlights the importance of managing complex application state with Redux, a critical skill for building scalable and maintainable frontend applications.

## Technologies Used

- React  
- Redux  
- OpenWeatherMap API  
- GitHub (for version control)  

## Features

- Fetches and displays real-time weather data for user-specified locations  
- Uses Redux to manage application state and asynchronous API calls  
- Clean and intuitive user interface for easy weather information access  
- Handles loading states and error messages gracefully  

## Why This Matters

Managing complex state effectively is essential for modern frontend engineering. This project demonstrates:

- Integration of third-party APIs for real-time data fetching  
- Handling asynchronous actions with Redux middleware (e.g., redux-thunk)  
- Designing maintainable UI components with clear state management  
- Building responsive dashboards and information tools  

These skills are valuable for companies developing interactive, data-driven applications that require robust and scalable frontend architectures.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed  
- Basic knowledge of React and Redux  

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/weather-app-redux.git

text

2. Navigate to the project directory:

cd weather-app-redux

text

3. Install dependencies:

npm install

text

4. Obtain an API key from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api).

5. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your API key:

REACT_APP_OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

text

6. Start the development server:

npm start

text

7. Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` to use the app.

## Usage

- Enter a city name to fetch and display current weather conditions.  
- The app updates the UI dynamically based on the Redux-managed state.  

## Example

// Example of dispatching an action to fetch weather
dispatch(fetchWeatherByCity('New York'));
